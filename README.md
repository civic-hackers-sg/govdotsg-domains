# govdotsg-domains

## Information

This repo contains listings of Singapore Government Domains in machine readable formats (JSON, CSV, etc) for use in other projects.

The data is taken from the [Singapore Government Directory](http://app.sgdi.gov.sg/index.asp?cat=0).

The initial format is a simple name/domain pair. Further enhancement is planned for more agency related data and a standardised format.
